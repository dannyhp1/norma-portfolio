A quinceañera is a Hispanic tradition that celebrates the transition of a girl to a young lady. My first quinceañera to take pictures of was my little sisters. I've learned that taking pictures a couple weeks prior to the actual party are more fun because it's a relaxed environment for the birthday gal/guy. It gives both of us the time to capture the best shots.
